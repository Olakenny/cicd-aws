# No/less ops overhead
# short mttr
# fast turn around on feature changes
# less distruptive

# comparison
# version control:
#         github -> code commit
# repository for dependencies:
#         sonatype nexus -> code artifact
# build services:
#         maven (jenkins job) -> code build
# artifact deployment:
#         jenkins -> code deploy (deploy to s3/beanstalk env)
# code qaulity check:
#         sonarqube server -> sonarcloud (not from aws)
# quality check:
#         checkstyle -> checkstyle
# software testing:
#         selenium -> selenium
# application host (paas for app hosting and db):
#         tomcat on ec2 instances -> beanstalk
#         mysql on ec2 instance -> amazon rds (db for app service)
# pipeline:
#         jenkins -> code pipeline (to integrate all the jobs together)

Procedures:

on aws acct, go to codecomit
create a repository 'kpro-code-repo' ( u can enable amazon code guru for code quality improvement--optional)
repo can be accessed by http or ssh connection (follow the steps given on aws) use ssh which is prefer method, http will
expose pw which can undermine the security.
